### `About`
Sessions is an app that allows an artist (rapper or singer) to post a project. Then a producer can submit a proposal to a specific project. Singers and rappers often times have to go to soundcloud or beat stores to collaborate with producers. Producers have to go on craigslist or upload their music on youtube, soundcloud, or beatstores in hopes of an artist wanting to hire them for their work. Sessions solves these problems by allowing artist and producers the ability to work together in a more direct way.
