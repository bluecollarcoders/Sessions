### `About`
Sessions is an app that allows an artist (rapper or singer) to post a project. Then a producer can submit a proposal to a specific project. Singers and rappers often times have to go to soundcloud or beat stores to collaborate with producers. Producers have to go on craigslist or upload their music on youtube, soundcloud, or beatstores in hopes of an artist wanting to hire them for their work. Sessions solves these problems by allowing artist and producers the ability to work together in a more direct way.

### `User Flow`

* User(Singer or Rapper) clicks on post project this will redirect them to a signup form.
* User will put in their information. Once form is completed they will be directed to a post project form.
* They will complete the form and submit. 
* The user is then directed to  the project they just posted along with other projects. 
* A producer can come to the site and click on the projects tab on the navigation bar and be directed to the project list without having to signup or login.
* They then can click on a project. This will direct them to a form where they can submit a proposal to that specific project. 
* Once the form is completed a proposal card will be assigned to that specific project. 
* This allows the user to see who submitted a proposal to their project.
